### Concepts

- Tabs: a container that allows users to switch between content views through tabs. Each tab corresponds to a content 
- List: a component that provides a series of list items with the same width and contains the child component **ListItem**.
- TapGesture: identifies tap gestures with one, two, or more taps.
- PanGesture: triggers the pan gesture, which requires a minimum 5 vp movement distance of a finger on the screen.
- PinchGesture: triggers a pinch gesture, which requires two to five fingers with a minimum 5 vp distance between the fingers.
- Property animation: used to implement gradient when the universal properties of a component change, improving user experience.
- Custom dialog box: displayed by using the **CustomDialogController** class. You can set the style and content to your preference for a custom dialog box.
- Canvas: a component that is used to customize drawings.
