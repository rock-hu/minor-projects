### Introduction

### Concepts

- UIAbility: functions as the basic unit scheduled by the system and provides a window for applications to draw UIs. A UIAbility component can implement a functional module through multiple pages. Each UIAbility component instance corresponds to a task in Recents.
- UIAbilityContext: provides APIs for accessing ability-specific resources. You can use the APIs to start and terminate an ability, obtain the caller interface, and request permissions from users by displaying a dialog box.
- Want: a carrier for information transfer between objects (application components). Want can be used as a parameter of **startAbility** to specify a startup target and information that needs to be carried during startup.
- HiLog: provides the HiLog capability for your applications to output logs based on the specified type, level, and format string. Such logs help you learn the running status of applications and better debug programs.
