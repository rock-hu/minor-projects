# UIAbility and Custom Component Lifecycle

### Introduction

This codelab introduces UIAbility and the custom component lifecycle.

### Concepts

- UIAbility: This component provides the UI for user interaction. It functions as the basic unit scheduled by the system and provides a window for applications to draw UIs. A UIAbility component can implement a functional module through multiple pages. Each UIAbility component instance corresponds to a task in Recents.
- Custom component lifecycle: The lifecycle callbacks of a custom component are used to notify users of the lifecycle of the component. These callbacks are private and are invoked by the development framework at a specified time at runtime. They cannot be manually invoked from applications.
- Window: This module provides a mechanism for displaying multiple application UIs and allowing the end user to interact with them on the same physical screen.
