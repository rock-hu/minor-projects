home
page.

2. Return to the home screen and tap the application again. The subsequent triggered lifecycle is displayed on the home
   page.

```

## How to Implement

To log the lifecycle on the home page, you can add **eventHub** listening to the **EntryAbility.ets** file.

- When the home page is first opened, the **onCreate**, **onWindowStageCreate**, and **onForeground** lifecycles are
  triggered. The
  **eventHub** is used to listen for the lifecycle and log the lifecycle on the page.
- When the user switches to the home screen and returns to the application, the **onBackground** and **onForeground** lifecycles
  are triggered. The **eventHub** is used to listen for the lifecycle and log the lifecycle on the page.
