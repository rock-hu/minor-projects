# **Optimization for Time-Consuming Operations in the Main Thread**
## Overview
In application development practices, it is important to effectively prevent the main thread from performing redundant and time-consuming operations. This can effectively reduce the load of the main thread and speed up the UI response. In scenarios where high-frequency callbacks are frequently triggered in a short period of time, time-consuming operations in the APIs need to be avoided to ensure that the main thread is not occupied for a long time. This prevents UI rendering from being blocked to avoid frame freezing or frame loss.
This sample describes common redundant operations, common high-frequency callback scenarios, and other main thread optimization methods during development.

## How to Use
The negative example of avoiding redundant operations includes printing redundant logs, tracing, and invoking callbacks without service code in the release version, reducing performance.

In the preceding examples, time-consuming operations should be avoided in the following common high-frequency callback scenarios:
* High-frequency event callback
* Component reuse callback
* Component lifecycle callback
* Repeated rendering
* Component properties

In the negative example, time-consuming operations are performed in the preceding high-frequency events, reducing performance.

The negative example of avoiding using time-consuming APIs uses APIs without specified resource IDs. As a result, the time consumption increases and the performance is affected.

In the positive example of using multiple threads, the page rendering speed is accelerated and the performance is improved.
