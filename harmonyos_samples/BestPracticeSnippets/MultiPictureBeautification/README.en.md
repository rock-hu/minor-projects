# Image Beautification

### Introduction

Learn to implement an image beautification app based on the adaptive layout and responsive layout, achieving one-time development for multi-device deployment.

#### Description

This codelab implements an image beautification app based on the adaptive layout and responsive layout, achieving one-time development for multi-device deployment. It uses the three-layer project architecture for code reuse and tailors the pages to different device sizes such as mobile phones, foldable phones, and PC/2-in-1 devices.
The following figure shows the effect on the mobile phone.

#### Concepts

- One-time development for multi-device deployment: It enables you to develop and release one set of project code for deployment on multiple devices as demanded. This feature enables you to efficiently develop applications that are compatible with multiple devices while providing distributed user experiences for cross-device transferring, migration, and collaboration.
- Area change event: It is triggered when the component's size, position, or any other attribute that may affect its display area changes.
- PinchGesture: It is used to trigger a pinch gesture, which requires two to five fingers with a minimum 5 vp distance between the fingers.

#### Permissions

N/A.

#### How to Use

- Install and open an app on a mobile phone, foldable phone, tablet, or PC/2-in-1 device. The responsive layout and adaptive layout are used to display different effects on the app pages over different devices.
- Tap the edit or album icon to access the photo editing page or album page.
