# Framework
React Native is an open-source framework based on JavaScript and React frameworks. It is used to build native mobile applications. It allows you to use React's component model and declarative programming style to build cross-platform mobile applications.

Main features and detailed introduction:

- Cross-platform: You only need to write code once to run applications on different platforms, such as iOS, Android, and React Native DOM, improving development efficiency and code reuse rate.
- React-based: React Native is based on the React framework and uses the React component model and virtual DOM technology.
- Native performance: The service logic of React Native applications is written using JavaScript, but it can call APIs provided by the native platform and use native UI components. This enables React Native applications to achieve performance and user experience close to those of native applications, including smooth scrolling and fast response.
- CodePush: React Native supports CodePush, which enables you to directly push the updated JavaScript code of an application to your device without recompilation.
- Flexibility and scalability: You can select third-party libraries and tools based on your actual requirements to extend and enhance application functions.
