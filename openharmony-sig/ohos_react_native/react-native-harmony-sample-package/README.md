# Sample Package
This project is an example of a harmony specific package.

## `harmony` directory
Open Harmony module will be copied here after running `react-native pack-harmony`. Currently, Open Harmony modules can't be installed, if they are placed outside Open Harmony project. An app developer needs to run `react-native unpack-harmony` after installation, to move those modules into harmony project. THe native code is in the tester project to allow fast development cycles.
