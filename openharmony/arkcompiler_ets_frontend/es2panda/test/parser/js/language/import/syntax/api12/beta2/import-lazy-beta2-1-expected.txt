Solutions: > Check the compatibleSdkVersion and compatibleSdkVersionStage in build-profile.json5.> If compatibleSdkVersion is set to API 12, then compatibleSdkVersionStage needs to be configured as beta3.> If you're running es2abc in commandline without IDE, please check whether target-api-version and target-api-sub-version options are correctly configured.
