// No report is provided during compilation
// nor during runtime if cast is wrong:
let c3 = createShape() as Square
console.log(c3.y) // undefined

// Important corner case for casting primitives to the boxed counterparts:
// The left operand is not properly boxed here in in runtime
// because "as" has no runtime effect in TypeScript
let e1 = (5.0 as Number) instanceof Number // false

// Number object is created and instanceof works as expected:
let e2 = (new Number(5.0)) instanceof Number // true
