/*
    Test case: T type from Partial<T> can not instantiate the Partial type.
    Explanation: Partial class is a completely different generated class, not connected to it's type parameter T.
                 Instantiating it with new T would require to have Partial<T> an effect on it's original
                 class T on modification (like any superclass relationship).
                 This behaviour isn't present here, as Partial<T> is not connected to T.
