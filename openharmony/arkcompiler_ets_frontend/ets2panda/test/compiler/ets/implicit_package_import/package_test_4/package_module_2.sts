// during compilation of this file, a "syntax error" is raised (which might be modified),that
// this file is being imported by another one, so compile it with "--ets-module". This causes
// that 'package_module_1.ets' won't be part of this compilation unit (so no error on import
// from package is thrown) as files in the package containing 'syntax errors' are ignored
//
// compiled with "--ets-module" switch the same error will be thrown as for 'package_module_1.sts'
