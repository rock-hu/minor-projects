/*
 * X64-bit Architecture.
 * After the argument values have been computed, they are placed either in registers
 * or pushed on the stack. The way how values are passed is described in the
 * following sections.
 *   - INTEGER This class consists of integral types that fit into one of the general
       purpose registers.
     - SSE The class consists of types that fit into a vector register.
     - SSEUP The class consists of types that fit into a vector register and can be passed
       and returned in the upper bytes of it.
     - X87, X87UP These classes consists of types that will be returned via the x87 FPU.
     - COMPLEX_X87 This class consists of types that will be returned via the x87 FPU.
     - NO_CLASS This class is used as initializer in the algorithms. It will be used for
       padding and empty structures and unions.
     - MEMORY This class consists of types that will be passed and returned in memory via the stack.
