/*
 * Description:
 * 1. This code tests the lazy deoptimization that occurs in ldobjbyname.
 *    After the JIT code for function 'f' is compiled,
 *    modifying an HClass invalidates the function,
 *    and subsequent accesses to it will detect this invalidation.
 * 2. Lazy deopt occurs on constructor.
