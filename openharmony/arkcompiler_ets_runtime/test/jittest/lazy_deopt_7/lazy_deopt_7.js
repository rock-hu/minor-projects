/*
 * Description:
 * 1. This code tests the lazy deoptimization that occurs in ldobjbyname.
 *    After the JIT code for function 'Test2' is compiled,
 *    modifying an HClass invalidates the function,
 *    and subsequent accesses to it will detect this invalidation.
 * 2. Speciall Test3 throw a exception before lazy deoptimization.
 *    It verifies that exceptions are handled correctly when lazy deoptimization is bypassed.
 *    Note: In this situation, lazy deoptimization will not be triggered.
