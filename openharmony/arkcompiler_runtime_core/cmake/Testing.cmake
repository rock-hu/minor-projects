# Add Googletest-based tests to the source tree.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   panda_add_gtest(NAME test_name
#     OUTPUT_DIRECTORY /path/to/output/dir
#     SOURCES
#       tests/unit1_test.c
#       tests/unit2_test.c
#     INCLUDE_DIRS
#       path/to/include1
#       path/to/include2
#     LIBRARIES
#       component1 component2
#     SANITIZERS sanitizer1,sanitizer2,..
#   )
#
# Available sanitizers: address, thread, undefined
#
# This will create a target test_name which consists of the sources defined
# in SOURCES and linked with libraries defined in LIBRARIES. If the list of
# paths is specified in INCLUDE_DIRS, these paths will be added as include
# directories for the test_name target.
#
# If OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is not defined, the binary will be put to bin-gtests
# directory at the build tree root.
#
# Notes:
#    * This function is a no-op if Googletest is not found.
#    * test_name behaves as a standard CMake target, i.e. such operations as
#      target_compile_options, etc. are supported.
#
# Additional actions on test_name include:
#    * Target-specific definition PANDA_GTEST is added.
#    * Googletest-specific libraries are linked to test_name by default,
#      no need to set them explicitly.
