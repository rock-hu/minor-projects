# Panda Binary File Format

This document describes Panda binary file format with the following goals in mind:

* Compactness.
* Support for fast access to information.
* Support for low memory footprint.
* Extensibility and compatibility.

## Compactness

Many mobile applications use a lot of types, methods and fields. Their number is so large that it
doesn't fit in 16-bit unsigned integer. It leads to application developer have to create several
files and as a result not all data can be deduplicated.

Current binary file format should extend these limits to conform to the modern requirements.

To achieve this, all references in the binary file are 4 bytes long. It allows to have 4Gb for
addressing fields, methods, classes, etc.

The format uses [TaggedValue](#taggedvalue) which allows to store only information we have and
avoid 0 offsets to absent information.

But to achieve more compactness 16-bit indexes are used to refer classes, methods and fields in
the bytecode and some metadata. File can contain multiple indexes each one covers part of the
file and described by [RegionHeader](#regionheader).

## Fast information access

Binary file format should support fast access to information. It means that
redundant references should be avoided. Also, if it possible, binary file format should avoid data
indexes (like sorted list of strings). However, the described binary format supports one index:
a sorted list of offsets to classes. This index is compact and allows to find a type definition
quickly, which runtime requires a lot during application launch time.

All classes, fields and methods are separated into 2 groups: foreign and local.
Foreign classes, fields and methods are declared in other files, with references from the
current binary file. Local classes, fields and methods are declared in the current file.
Local entities has the same header as the corresponding foreign. So
having an offset to an entity it doesn't matter whether the entity is local or foreign.

Runtime can easily check type of an offset by checking it is in the foreign region
(*\[foreign_off; foreign_off + foreign_size)*).
Depending on the result runtime can search the entity in other files (for foreign entities)
or create a runtime object from the definition by the offset (for local entities).

To improve data access speed most data structures have 4 bytes alignment.
Since most target architectures are little endian all multibyte values are little endian.

## Offsets

Unless otherwise specified, all offsets are calculated from the beginning of the file.
An offset cannot contain values in the range *\[0; 32)*, except for specially mentioned cases.

## Support for low memory footprint

As practice shows, most of file data is not used by the application. It means memory footprint
of a file may be significantly reduced by grouping frequently used data.
To support this feature, the described binary file format uses offsets and doesn't specify how
structures should be located relatively to each other.

## Extensibility and compatibility

The binary file format supports future changes via version number.
The version field in the header is 4 bytes long and is encoded as byte array to
avoid misinterpretation on platforms with different endianness.

Any tool which supports format version `N` must support format version `N - 1` too.

## Data types

| Type       | Description                                  |
| ----       | -----------                                  |
| `uint8_t`  | 8-bit unsigned integer value                 |
| `uint16_t` | 16-bit unsigned integer value                |
| `uint32_t` | 32-bit little endian unsigned integer value. |
| `uleb128`  | unsigned integer value in leb128 encoding.   |
| `sleb128`  | signed integer value in leb128 encoding.     |

### MUTF-8 Encoding

Binary file format uses MUTF-8 (Modified UTF-8) encoding for strings.

### String

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `utf16_length`     | `uleb128`     | `len << 1 \| is_ascii` where `len` is the length of the string in UTF-16 code units. |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | 0-terminated character sequence in MUTF-8 encoding. |

### TaggedValue

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `tag_value`        | `uint8_t`     | The first 8 bits contain tag which determines the meaning of the data. Depending on the tag there may be optional data. Runtime must be able to determine size of the data. |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | Optional payload. |

## String syntax

### TypeDescriptor

```
TypeDescriptor -> PrimitiveType | ArrayType | RefType
PrimitiveType  -> 'Z' | 'B' | 'H' | 'S' | 'C' | 'I' | 'U' | 'J' | 'Q' | 'F' | 'D' | 'A'
ArrayType      -> '[' TypeDescriptor
RefType        -> 'L' ClassName ';'
```

`PrimitiveType` is a one letter encoding for primitive type

| Type  | Encoding |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | `Z` |
| `i8`  | `B` |
| `u8`  | `H` |
| `i16` | `S` |

| `f32` | `F` |
| `f64` | `D` |
| `i64` | `J` |
| `u64` | `Q` |
| `any` | `A` |

`ClassName` is a qualified name of a class with `.` replaced with `/`.

Source language can be specified for classes and methods. For classes Panda Assembly language is assumed by default. Default language for methods is the class's one.

## Data layout

A file begins with the header which is located at offset 0.
All other data can be reached from the header.

Constraint: size of header must be > 16 bytes. [FieldType](#fieldType) uses this fact.

### RegionHeader

To address file structures using 16-bit indexes file is split into regions. Each region has class, method, field and proto indexes and described by `RegionHeader` structure.

Alignment: 4 bytes

Format:

| Name              | Format     | Description |

`RegionIndex` structure is aimed to allow runtime to find index structure that covers specified offset in the file.
It is organized as an array of [RegionHeader](#regionheader) structures.
All regions are sorted by the start offset of the region. Number of elements in the index is `num_index_regions`
from [Header](#header).

### FieldTag

| Name                      | Tag    | Quantity | Data format  | Description |
| ----                      | :-:    | :------: | -----------  | ----------- |

Note: Only `INT_VALUE` or `VALUE` tags must be present.

### FieldType

Since the first bytes of the file contain the header and size of the header > 16 bytes, any offset in the range `[0; sizeof(Header))` is invalid.
`FieldType` encoding uses this fact to encode primitive types of the field in the low 4 bits.
For non-primitive type the value is an offset to [Class](#class) or to
[ForeignClass](#foreignclass). In both cases [FieldType](#fieldtype) is `uint32_t`.

Primitive types are encoded as follows:

| Type  | Code |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | 0x00 |
| `i8`  | 0x01 |
| `u8`  | 0x02 |
| `i16` | 0x03 |
| `u16` | 0x04 |
| `i32` | 0x05 |
| `u32` | 0x06 |
| `f32` | 0x07 |

#### Shorty

Shorty is a short description of method's signature without detailed information about reference types.
A shorty begins with a return type followed by method arguments and ends with `0x0`.

Shorty syntax:

```
Shorty -> ReturnType ParamTypeList End
ReturnType -> Type
ParamTypeList -> '' | Type ParamTypeList
Type -> <encoded type>
End -> 0x0
```

`<encoded type>` must be one of:

| Type   | Value   |
| ----   | :---:   |
| `void` | `0x01`  |
| `u1`   | `0x02`  |
| `i8`   | `0x03`  |
| `u8`   | `0x04`  |
| `i16`  | `0x05`  |
| `u16`  | `0x06`  |
| `i32`  | `0x07`  |
| `u32`  | `0x08`  |
| `f32`  | `0x09`  |
| `f64`  | `0x0a`  |
| `i64`  | `0x0b`  |
| `u64`  | `0x0c`  |
| `ref`  | `0x0d`  |
| `any`  | `0x0e`  |

All shorty elements are divided into groups of 4 elements starting from the beginning.
Each group is encoded in `uint16_t`. Each element is encoded in 4 bits.
A group with 4 elements `v1`, `v2`, ..., `v4` is encoded in `uint16_t` as follow:

```
| bits   | 0 - 3 | 4 - 7 | 8 - 11 | 12 - 15 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| values | v1    | v2    | v3     | v4      |
```

If the group contains less then 4 elements the rest bits are filled with `0x0`.

### DebugInfo

Debug information contains mapping between program counter of a method and line numbers in source
code and information about local variables. The format is derived from DWARF Debugging Information
Format, Version 3 (see item 6.2). The mapping and local variable information are encoded in
[line number program](#line-number-program) which is interpreted by
[the state machine](#state-machine). To deduplicate the same line number programs of different
methods all constants the program refers to are moved into [the constant pool](#constant-pool).

| Name                      | Format          | Description |
| ----                      | ------          | ----------- |
| `line_start`              | `uleb128`       | The initial value of line register of [the state machine](#state-machine). |
| `num_parameters`          | `uleb128`       | Number of method parameters. |
| `parameters`              | `uleb128[]`     | Parameters names of the method. The array has `num_parameters` elements. Each element is an offset to [String](#string) or 0 if there is no name. |
| `constant_pool_size`      | `uleb128`       | Size of constant pool in bytes. |
| `constant_pool`           | `uleb128[]`     | [Constant pool](#constant-pool) data of length `constant_pool_size` bytes. |
| `line_number_program_idx` | `uleb128`       | [Line number program](#line-number-program) index in a [`LineNumberProgramIndex`](#linenumberprogramindex) structure. The program has variable length and ends with `DBG_END_SEQUENCE` opcode. |

#### Constant pool

Many methods has similar line number program. The difference is only in variable names,
variable types and file names. To deduplicate such programs all constants the program refers to
are stored in the constant pool. During interpretation of the program
[the state machine](#state-machine) tracks a pointer to the constant pool.
When [the state machine](#state-machine) interprets an instruction which requires a constant
argument the machine reads the value from memory constant pool pointer points to and then increments
the pointer. Thus programs has no explicit references to constants and could be deduplicated.

#### State Machine

The aim of the state machine is to generate a mapping between program counter and line numbers and
local variable information. The machine has the following registers:

| Name                 | Initial value | Description       |
| ----                 | ------------- | ----------------- |
| `address`            | 0             | Program counter (refers to method's instructions). Must only monotonically increase. |
| `line`               | `line_start` from [DebugInfo](#debug_info). | Unsigned integer which corresponds to line number in source code. All lines are numbered beginning at 1 so the register mustn't have value less then 1. |
| `file`               | Value of `SOURCE_FILE` tag in `class_data` (see [Class](#class)) or 0 | Offset to the name of source file. If there is no such information (`SOURCE_FILE` tag is absent in [Class](#class)) then the register has value 0. |
| `prologue_end`       | `false`       | The register indicates the current address is one where entry breakpoint of the method could be set. |
| `epilogue_begin`     | `false`       | The register indicates the current address is one where exit breakpoint of the method could be set. |
| `constant_pool_ptr`  | Address of the `constant_pool`'s first byte from [DebugInfo](#debug_info). | Pointer to the current constant value. |

#### Line Number Program

A line number program consists of instructions. Each instruction has one byte opcode and optional arguments. Depending on opcode argument's value may be encoded into the instruction or the instruction requires reading the value from constant pool.

| Opcode                 | Value        | Instruction Format | Constant pool arguments   | Description                           |

The number of the register contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. The name is an offset to [String](#String) and the type is an offset to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass) or [Class](#class). The offsets may be `0` which means the corresponding information is absent. |
| `START_LOCAL_EXTENDED` | `0x04`       | `sleb128`          | `uleb128 uleb128 uleb128` | Introduce a local variable with name, type and type signature the *constant_pool_ptr* refers to at the current address. The number of the register contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. The name is an offset to [String](#String), the type is an offset to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass) or [Class](#class) and the signature is an offset to TODO: figure out what are signatures. The offsets may be `0` which means the corresponding information is absent. |
| `END_LOCAL`            | `0x05`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Mark the local variable in the specified register is out of scope. The register number is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. |
| `RESTART_LOCAL`        | `0x06`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Re-introduces a local variable at the specified register. The name and type are the same as the last local that was in the register. The register number is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. |
| `SET_PROLOGUE_END`     | `0x07`       |                    |                           | Set `prologue_end` register to `true`. Any special opcodes clear `prologue_end` register. |
| `SET_EPILOGUE_BEGIN`   | `0x08`       |                    |                           | Set `epilogue_end` register to `true`. Any special opcodes clear `epilogue_end` register. |

Special opcodes:

[The state machine](#state-machine) interprets each special opcode as follow
(see DWARF Debugging Information Format item 6.2.5.1 Special Opcodes):

1. Calculate the adjusted opcode: `adjusted_opcode = opcode - OPCODE_BASE`.
2. Increment `address` register: `address += adjusted_opcode / LINE_RANGE`.
3. Increment `line` register: `line += LINE_BASE + (adjusted_opcode % LINE_RANGE)`.
4. Emit line number.
5. Set `prologue_end` register to `false`.
6. Set `epilogue_begin` register to `false`.

Where:

* `OPCODE_BASE = 0x0c`: the first special opcode.
* `LINE_BASE = -4`: the smallest line number increment.
* `LINE_RANGE = 15`: the number of line increments presented.
