# There seems to be a bug in either clang-tidy or CMake:
# When clang/gcc is used for cross-compilation, it is ran on host and use defines and options for host
# For example for arm32 cross-compilation Clang-Tidy:
#   - don't know about -march=armv7-a
#   - believes that size of pointer is 64 instead of 32 for aarch32
# TODO: Retry once we upgrade the checker.
