/**
 * Load Store Elimination (Lse) optimization is aimed to eliminate redundant
 * loads and store.  It uses Alias Analysis to determine which memory
 * instructions are redundant.  Lse has the heap representation in form of
 *
 * "Memory Instruction" -> "Value stored at location pointed by instruction"
 *
 * Generally, this optimization tries to:
 * 1) delete stores that attempt to store the same values that already have
 * been been stored by a previous store
 * 2) delete loads that attempt to load values that were previously loaded or
 * stored (optimization keep track what was stored previously)
 *
 * Traversing basic blocks in RPO optimization does the following with
 * instructions:
 * - if the instruction is a store and a stored value is equal to value from
 * heap for this store then this store can be eliminated.
 * - if the instruction is a store and a value from heap for this store is
 * absent or differs from new stored value then the new stored value is written
 * into heap.  The values of memory instructions that MUST_ALIAS this store are
 * updated as well.  All values in the heap that MAY_ALIAS this store
 * instruction are invalidated.
 * - if the instruction is a load and there is a value from the heap for this
 * load then this load can be eliminated.
 * - if the instruction is a load and there is no value from the heap for this
 * load then we update heap value for this load with the result of this load.
 * All instructions that MUST_ALIAS this load updated as well.
 * - if the instruction is a volatile load then the whole heap is invalidated.
 * - if the instruction is a call then the whole heap is invalidated.
 *
 * Instructions that invalidate heap are enumerated in IsHeapInvalidatingInst.
 * Instructions that cannot be eliminated are presented in
 * CanEliminateInstruction.
 *
 * Another noticeable points:
 * - Heap is invalided at loop headers basic blocks because values can be
 * overwritten by using back edges.
 * - Heap for basic block is obtained by merging heaps from predecessors.  If
 * heap value conflicts among predecessors it is not added.
 * - Instructions are deleted at the end of pass.  If a deleted instruction is
 * the cause that another instruction now without users, this instruction is
 * deleted as well.  This process continues recursively.
 *
 * Loops are handled in the following way:
 * - on the loop header we record all loads from preheader's heap.  They are
 * potential memory accesses that can be used to eliminated accesses inside the
 * loop. We call them phi-candidates (in future they can be used to reuse
 * stores inside the loop).
 * - visiting any memory access inside a loop we check the aliasing with
 * phi-candidates and record aliased ones to a corresponding candidate.
 * - all phi-candidates of a loop (and of all outer loops of this loop) are
 * invalidated if any of instructions that invalidate heap have been met in
 * this loop.
 * - after actual deletion of collected accesses for elimination we iterate
 * over candidates with aliased accesses.  If any of aliased accesses for a
 * candidate is a store, we do nothing.  If among aliased accesses only loads,
 * we simply replace MUST_ALIASed loads with the corresponding candidate.
