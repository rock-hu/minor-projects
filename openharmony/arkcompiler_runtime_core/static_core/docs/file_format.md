# Panda Binary File Format

This document describes the Panda binary file format with the following goals
in mind:

* Compactness,
* Support for fast access to information,
* Support for low memory footprint, and
* Extensibility and compatibility.

|

## Compactness

Many mobile applications use numerous types, methods and fields. Their number
is so large that it does not fit into a 16-bit unsigned integer. It makes an
application developer create several files, and not all data can be deduplicated
as a result.

Current binary file format must extend these limits to conform to modern
requirements. To achieve this, all references in a binary file are 4 bytes long.
It allows having 4Gb for addressing fields, methods, classes, etc.

The format uses [TaggedValue](#taggedvalue) which allows storing only the
information available and avoids 0 offsets to any missing information.

In order to achieve greater compactness, 16-bit indices are used to refer to
classes, methods and fields in the bytecode and some metadata. A file can
contain multiple indices, each one covering a part of the file as described
in [RegionHeader](#regionheader).

|

## Fast information access

The binary file format must support fast access to information. It means that
redundant references are to be avoided. Where possible, the binary file format
must also avoid data indices (like sorted list of strings). However, the binary
format described above supports one index: a sorted list of offsets to classes.
This index is compact and allows finding type definitions quickly (while finding
type definitions normally requires much runtime when launching an application).

All classes, fields, and methods are foreign or local as explained below:

-  *Foreign* classes, fields, and methods are declared in other files and
   referenced from the current binary file.
-  *Local* classes, fields and methods are declared within the current file.
   A local entity has the same header as the corresponding foreign entity.

It is irrelevant for an entity offset whether the entity is local or foreign.

Runtime can easily check the offset type by checking it in the foreign region
(*\[foreign_off; foreign_off + foreign_size)*). Depending on the result, the
following occurs at runtime:

-  In case of a foreign entity, the search for an entity is performed in other
   files, or
-  In case of a local entity, a runtime object is created from the definition
   by the offset.

Most data structures have the 4-byte alignment in order to improve the speed of
data access.

All multibyte values are little-endian as most target architectures are.

|

## Offsets

Unless otherwise specified, all offsets are calculated from the beginning of
the file.

An offset cannot contain values in the range *\[0; 32)*, except in some cases
mentioned specifically.

|

## Support for low memory footprint

As practice proves, applications make no use of most file data. Memory footprint
of a file can be significantly reduced as a consequence by grouping the data
that is used frequently. To support this feature, the described binary file
format uses offsets and does not specify how structures must be located
in relation to one another.

|

## Extensibility and compatibility

The binary file format supports future changes via version number.
The version field in the header is 4 bytes long and is encoded as byte array to
avoid misinterpretation on platforms with different endianness.

Any tool which supports format version `N` must support format version `N - 1` too.

## Data types

| Type       | Description                                  |
| ----       | -----------                                  |
| `uint8_t`  | 8-bit unsigned integer value                 |
| `uint16_t` | 16-bit unsigned integer value                |
| `uint32_t` | 32-bit little endian unsigned integer value  |
| `uleb128`  | unsigned integer value in leb128 encoding    |
| `sleb128`  | signed integer value in leb128 encoding      |

|

### MUTF-8 Encoding

Binary file format uses MUTF-8 (Modified UTF-8) encoding for strings.

|

### String

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `utf16_length`     | `uleb128`     | `len << 1 \| is_ascii` where `len` is the length of the string in UTF-16 code units |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | 0-terminated character sequence in MUTF-8 encoding |

|

### TaggedValue

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `tag_value`        | `uint8_t`     | The first 8 bits contain tag which determines the meaning of the data. Depending on the tag, optional data is possible. Runtime must be able to determine the size of data. |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | Optional payload |

|

## String syntax

|

### TypeDescriptor

```
TypeDescriptor -> PrimitiveType | ArrayType | RefType
PrimitiveType  -> 'Z' | 'B' | 'H' | 'S' | 'C' | 'I' | 'U' | 'J' | 'Q' | 'F' | 'D' | 'A'
ArrayType      -> '[' TypeDescriptor
RefType        -> 'L' ClassName ';'
```

`PrimitiveType` is a one-letter encoding for a primitive type:

| Type  | Encoding |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | `Z` |
| `i8`  | `B` |
| `u8`  | `H` |
| `i16` | `S` |
| `u16` | `C` |
| `i32` | `I` |
| `u32` | `U` |
| `f32` | `F` |
| `f64` | `D` |
| `i64` | `J` |
| `u64` | `Q` |
| `any` | `A` |

`ClassName` is a qualified name of a class with `.` replaced with `/`.

| Reserved         | `0x02 - 0x0f` |


Source language can be specified for classes and methods. For classes,
Panda Assembly language is assumed by default. Default language for methods
is that of the class.

|

## Data layout

A file begins with the header which is located at offset 0.
All other data can be reached from the header.

|

### Header

Alignment: 4 bytes

Format:

Constraint: size of header must be > 16 bytes. [FieldType](#fieldType) uses this fact.

|

### RegionHeader

To address file structures using 16-bit indices, the file is split into regions. Each region has a class, a method, a field, and proto indices. It is described in the `RegionHeader` structure.

Alignment: 4 bytes

Format:

| Name              | Format     | Description |
| ----              | ------     | ----------- |

Constraint: regions must not overlap each other.

|

### RegionIndex

`RegionIndex` structure is aimed to allow runtime to find index structure that covers specified offset in the file.
It is organized as an array of [RegionHeader](#regionheader) structures.
All regions are sorted by the start offset of the region. Number of elements in the index is `num_index_regions`
from [Header](#header).

| `field_data`       | `TaggedValue[]` | Variable length list of tagged values. Each element must have type [TaggedValue](#taggedvalue). Tag must have values from [FieldTag](#fieldtag), and follow the order of increasing tag (except `0x00` tag). |

**Note**. Proper region index to resolve `class_idx` and `type_idx` can be found by a field's offset.

|

### FieldTag

| Name                      | Tag    | Quantity | Data format  | Description |
| ----                      | :-:    | :------: | -----------  | ----------- |
| `NOTHING`                 | `0x00` | `1`      | `none`       | No more values. The value with this tag must be the last. |
| `INT_VALUE`               | `0x01` | `0-1`    | `sleb128`    | Integral value of the field. This tag is used when the field has type `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, or `int`. |

**Note**. Only `INT_VALUE` or `VALUE` tags must be present.

|

### FieldType

Any offset in the range `[0; sizeof(Header))` is invalid because the first bytes of the file contain the header, and the size of the header is longer than 16 bytes.
`FieldType` encoding uses this fact to encode primitive types of the field in the low 4 bits.
The value of a non-primitive type is an offset to [Class](#class) or to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass). In either case, [FieldType](#fieldtype) is `uint32_t`.

Primitive types are encoded as follows:

| Type  | Code |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | 0x00 |
| `i8`  | 0x01 |
| `u8`  | 0x02 |
| `i16` | 0x03 |
| `u16` | 0x04 |
| `i32` | 0x05 |
| `u32` | 0x06 |
| `f32` | 0x07 |
| `f64` | 0x08 |
| `i64` | 0x09 |
| `u64` | 0x0a |
| `any` | 0x0b |

| `reference_types`  | `uint16_t[]`  | Array of indices of the method's signature non-primitive types. Each non-primitive type in a ``shorty`` has a corresponding element in the array. The size of the array equals the number of reference types in the ``shorty``. |

**Note**. Proper region index to resolve reference types indices can be found by the proto's offset.

|

#### Shorty

*Shorty* is a short description of a method's signature without detailed
information on reference types. A ``shorty`` begins with a return type followed
by method arguments, and ends with `0x0`.

The ``shorty`` syntax is as follows:

```
Shorty -> ReturnType ParamTypeList End
ReturnType -> Type
ParamTypeList -> '' | Type ParamTypeList
Type -> <encoded type>
End -> 0x0
```

`<encoded type>` must be one of:

| Type   | Value   |
| ----   | :---:   |
| `void` | `0x01`  |
| `u1`   | `0x02`  |
| `i8`   | `0x03`  |
| `u8`   | `0x04`  |
| `i16`  | `0x05`  |
| `u16`  | `0x06`  |
| `i32`  | `0x07`  |
| `u32`  | `0x08`  |
| `f32`  | `0x09`  |
| `f64`  | `0x0a`  |
| `i64`  | `0x0b`  |
| `u64`  | `0x0c`  |
| `ref`  | `0x0d`  |
| `any`  | `0x0e`  |

All ``shorty`` elements are divided into groups of 4 elements starting from the
beginning. Each group is encoded in `uint16_t`. Each element is encoded in 4
bits. A group of four elements `v1`, `v2`, ..., `v4` is encoded in `uint16_t`
as follow:

```
| bits   | 0 - 3 | 4 - 7 | 8 - 11 | 12 - 15 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| values | v1    | v2    | v3     | v4      |
```

If the group contains less then 4 elements, then the rest bits are filled
with `0x0`.

### InstDebugInfo

Debug information contains mapping between program counter of a method, line
numbers in source code, and information about local variables. The format is
derived from DWARF Debugging Information Format, Version 3 (see item 6.2).
The mapping and local variable information are encoded in
[line number program](#line-number-program), which is interpreted by
[the state machine](#state-machine). All constants the program refers to are
moved into [the constant pool](#constant-pool) in order to deduplicate the same
line number programs of different methods.

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name                      | Format          | Description |
| ----                      | ------          | ----------- |
| `line_start`              | `uleb128`       | The initial value of line register of [the state machine](#state-machine). |
| `num_parameters`          | `uleb128`       | Number of method parameters. |
| `parameters`              | `uleb128[]`     | Parameters names of the method. The array has `num_parameters` elements. Each element is an offset to [String](#string) or 0 if there is no name. |
| `constant_pool_size`      | `uleb128`       | Size of constant pool in bytes. |
| `constant_pool`           | `uleb128[]`     | [Constant pool](#constant-pool) data of length `constant_pool_size` bytes. |
| `line_number_program_idx` | `uleb128`       | [Line number program](#line-number-program) index in a [`LineNumberProgramIndex`](#linenumberprogramindex) structure. The program has variable length and ends with `DBG_END_SEQUENCE` opcode. |

|

#### Constant pool

Many methods have similar line number programs. The difference is only in
variable names, variable types, and file names. In order to deduplicate such
programs, all constants the program refers to are stored in the constant pool.
During program interpretation, [the state machine](#state-machine) tracks a
pointer to the constant pool. When [the state machine](#state-machine) interprets
an instruction that requires a constant argument, the machine reads memory for
the value that the constant pool pointer points to, and then increments the
pointer. Thus, the program has no explicit reference to constants, and can be
deduplicated.

|

#### State Machine

The aim of the state machine is to generate mapping between the program counter,
line numbers, and local variable information. The machine has the following
registers:

| Name                 | Initial value | Description       |
| ----                 | ------------- | ----------------- |
| `address`            | 0             | Program counter (refers to method's instructions). Must monotonically increase only. |
| `line`               | `line_start` from [InstDebugInfo](#debug_info). | Unsigned integer which corresponds to a line number in source code. All lines are numbered beginning at 1, and the register must not have a value less then 1. |
| `file`               | Value of `SOURCE_FILE` tag in `class_data` (see [Class](#class)) or 0 | Offset to the name of source file. If there is no such information (`SOURCE_FILE` tag is absent in [Class](#class)), then the register value is 0. |
| `prologue_end`       | `false`       | The register indicates the current address that is the one where entry breakpoint of the method can be set. |
| `epilogue_begin`     | `false`       | The register indicates the current address that is the one where exit breakpoint of the method can be set. |
| `constant_pool_ptr`  | Address of the `constant_pool`'s first byte from [InstDebugInfo](#debug_info). | Pointer to the current constant value. |

|

#### Line Number Program

A line number program consists of instructions. Each instruction has one byte
opcode and optional arguments. Depending on opcode, an argument's value can be
encoded into the instruction. Otherwise, the instruction requires the value
to be read from the constant pool.

| Opcode                 | Value        | Instruction Format | Constant pool arguments   | Description                           |
| ------                 | -----        | ------------------ | -----------------------   | -----------                           |
| `END_SEQUENCE`         | `0x00`       |                    |                           | Marks the end of line number program. |

The number of the register that contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. Register value `-1` signifies the accumulator register. The name is an offset to [String](#String), and the type is an offset to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass) or [Class](#class). If offset is `0`, then the corresponding information is missing. |
| `START_LOCAL_EXTENDED` | `0x04`       | `sleb128`          | `uleb128 uleb128 uleb128` | Introduces a local variable with the name, type, and type signature that `constant_pool_ptr` refers to at the current address. The number of the register that contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. Register value `-1` signifies the accumulator register.

| `END_LOCAL`            | `0x05`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Marks that local variable in the specified register is out of scope. The register number is encoded in the instruction. Register value `-1` signifies the accumulator register. |
| `RESTART_LOCAL`        | `0x06`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Re-introduces a local variable at the specified register. The name and type are the same as the last local in the register. The number of the register is encoded in the instruction. Register value `-1` signifies the accumulator register. |

| `SET_COLUMN` | `0x0b` | | `uleb128` | Sets `column` register by the value that `constant_pool_ptr` refers to |
| Special opcodes        | `0x0c..0xff` |                    |                           | |

Special opcodes:

[The state machine](#state-machine) interprets each special opcode as follows
(see DWARF Debugging Information Format item 6.2.5.1 Special Opcodes):

1. Calculate the adjusted opcode: `adjusted_opcode = opcode - OPCODE_BASE`.
2. Increment `address` register: `address += adjusted_opcode / LINE_RANGE`.
3. Increment `line` register: `line += LINE_BASE + (adjusted_opcode % LINE_RANGE)`.
4. Emit line number.
5. Set `prologue_end` register to `false`.
6. Set `epilogue_begin` register to `false`.

Where:

* `OPCODE_BASE = 0x0c`: the first special opcode.
* `LINE_BASE = -4`: the smallest line number increment.
* `LINE_RANGE = 15`: the number of line increments presented.
