	It is in a machine-readable format and intended to be the single source of

	and tools, faster changes (which is important on early stages of development),
	consistency between components.
- schema.json
	Schema for isa.yaml validation
- templates/
	Directory with example template files which show how could one generate needed
	files from isa.yaml using standard Ruby ERB templates.
	From <name>.<extenstion>.erb template <name>.<extension> file would be generated.
	(You also need to register your template in CMakeLists.txt)
- isapi.rb
	API for quering parsed yaml data which could be used for template generation.
	In a template you have access to all Ruby core libraries and to 'Panda' module.
	Please refer to the file itself for more details.
