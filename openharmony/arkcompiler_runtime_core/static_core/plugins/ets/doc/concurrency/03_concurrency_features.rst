Concurrency features in ArkTS language
######################################

***********************
Language level features
***********************

===============
async functions
===============

.. note::
  more verbose description you can find in the ArkTS language specification

The function *async* is implicitly a coroutine that can be called as a regular function.

By default *async* function, is :ref:`AJCoroutine<AJcoroutine>`

The return type of an *async* function must be *Promise<T>* (see
:ref:`Promise<Concurrency Promise Class>`).
Returning values of types *Promise<T>* and *T* from the function *async*
is allowed.

Using return statement without expression is allowed if the return type
is *Promise<void>*.
*No-argument* return statement can be implicitly added as the last statement
of the function body if there is no explicit return statement in a function
with the return type *Promise<void>*.

**Note**: Using this annotation is not recommended because this type of
functions is only supported for the sake of backward TypeScript compatibility.

=====
await
=====

.. _await:

``await`` is used for waiting :ref:`Promise<Concurrency Promise Class>`

If the Promise not resolved current coroutine will be suspended till it be resolved.

If the :ref:'Promise<Concurrency Promise Class>' is rejected, then the reason of rejection will be thrown.
