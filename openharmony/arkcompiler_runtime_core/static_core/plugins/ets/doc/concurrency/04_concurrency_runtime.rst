********************************
Concurrency in the ArkTS runtime
********************************

=============================
Worker threads and coroutines
=============================

For supporting `coroutines` in ArkTS we use pool of worker threads for running them. So we have M:N concurrency (M threads used for executing of N coroutines).

.. uml:: concurrency_worker_threads_and_coroutines_components.plantuml

There are some rules for different coroutines for migration, so some coroutines can have affinity to specific worker thread or to the parent coroutine.

=========
Scheduler
=========

The scheduler is responsible for fair scheduling of coroutines on the general Coroutine Worker threads. Also it guarantees that some coroutines which shouldn't
migrate will keep their domain and worker thread invariant.
