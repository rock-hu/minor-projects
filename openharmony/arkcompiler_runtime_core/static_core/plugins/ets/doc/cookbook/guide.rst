How to Use the Cookbook
=======================

The main goal of this cookbook is to provide recipes for all partially
supported features, and explicitly list all unsupported features. The document
is built on the feature-by-feature basis. If you do not find a feature, then
you can safely consider it **supported**. Otherwise, a recipe will give you
a suggestion on how to rewrite your code and work around an unsupported case.

.. _Recipe Explained:

Recipe Explained
----------------

The original |TS| code containing the keyword ``var``:

.. code-block:: typescript

    function addTen(x: number): number {
        var ten = 10
        return x + ten
    }

---must be rewritten as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript

    // Important! This is still valid TypeScript.
    function addTen(x: number): number {
        let ten = 10
        return x + ten
    }

|

.. _Severity Levels:

Severity Levels
---------------

Each recipe has a severity level mark. The supported values are as follows:

- |CB_ERROR|: You are to follow the recipe, otherwise program compilation fails.
- |CB_WARNING|: You are highly recommended to follow the recipe. Failing to
  follow the recipe will not affect the compilation currently, but will cause
  compilation failure in the future versions.

|

.. _Status of Unsupported Features:

Status of Unsupported Features
------------------------------

Currently unsupported are mainly the features that degrade the following:

- Runtime performance, by being related to dynamic typing;
- Project build time, by requiring extra support during compilation.

However, the |LANG| team reserves the right to reconsider and **shrink** the
list in future releases based on the developer feedback and more real-world
data experiments.
