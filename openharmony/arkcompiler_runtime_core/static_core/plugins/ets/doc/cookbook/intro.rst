Welcome to the "|TS| to |LANG|" cookbook. This document gives you short
recipes to rewrite your standard |TS| code to |LANG|. Although |LANG| is
designed to be close to |TS|, some limitations were added for the sake of
performance. As a result, all |TS| features can be categorized as follows:

#. **Fully supported features**: no modification of the original code is
   required. According to our measurements, projects that already follow the
   best |TS| practices can keep 90% to 97% of their codebase intact.
#. **Partially supported features**: some minor code refactoring is needed.
   Example: The keyword ``var`` must be replaced for ``let`` to declare
   variables. Please note that your code will still remain a valid |TS| code
   after rewriting by our recipes.
#. **Unsupported features**: more code refactoring can be required. Example:
   The type ``any`` is unsupported, and you are to introduce explicit
   typing to your code everywhere ``any`` is used.
