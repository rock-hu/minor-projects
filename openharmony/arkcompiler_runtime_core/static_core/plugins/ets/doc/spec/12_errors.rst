Error Handling
##############

|LANG| is designed to provide first-class support in responding to, and
recovering from different erroneous conditions in a program.

Two kinds of situations can occur and interrupt normal program
execution:

-  Runtime errors (e.g., null pointer dereferencing, array bounds
   checking, or division by zero);

-  Operation completion failures (e.g., the task of reading
   and processing data from a file on disk can fail if the file does
   not exist on a specified path, read permissions are not available,
   or else).


.. index::
   execution
   null pointer dereferencing
   runtime error
   array bounds checking
   completion
   normal execution
   normal completion
   completion failure
   path
   read permission

This specification uses the terms as follows:

-  *Error* to denote runtime errors, and

-  *Exception* to denote failures.


The difference between these two terms is that *exceptions* are the
*normal* and expected way for an operation to complete. A program
is expected to resolve some exceptions, and inform the user if it
cannot.

On the contrary, *errors* indicate that there is a failure of the
program logic, or even of the hardware. The program can recover in
some but not all cases.

As a result, exceptions can be handled in a much more effective
manner than errors.

.. index::
   runtime error
   failure
   exception
   runtime

Some modern programming languages support only exceptions; others
support only errors. |LANG| is based on the presumption that both
*exceptions* and *errors* must be supported. ``Exception`` and
``Error`` as predefined types are discussed below.

Exceptions are described in the chapter Experimental Features (see
:ref:`Exceptions`) of this specification.

``Error`` is the base class of all errors. Defining a new error class is
normally not required because essential error classes for various cases (e.g.,
``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError``) are defined in the standard library (see
:ref:`Standard Library`).

However, a developer can define a new error by using ``Error``, or any
derived class as the base of the new class. An example of error handling is
provided below:

.. index::
   error
   class
   error handling
   derived class

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class UnknownError extends Error { // User-defined error class 
      error: Error
      constructor (error: Error) {
         super()
         this.error = error
      }
    }

    function get_array_element<T>(array: T[], index: number): T|null {
        try {
          return array[index] // access array
        }
        catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError) // invalid index detected
             return null
          throw new UnknownError (error as Error) // Unknown error occurred
        }
    }


A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a generic class is directly or
indirectly a subclass of ``Error``.

In most cases, errors are raised by the |LANG| runtime system, or by the
standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`) code.

The ``throw`` statements (see :ref:`Throw Statements`) allow throwing both
exceptions and errors. Throwing exceptions provide a structured way to
handle a range of unexpected situations in the application code. Throwing
errors in such a context is not recommended.

The ``try`` statements (see :ref:`Try Statements`) are used to handle
errors in a manner similar to the handling of exceptions.

**Note**: Not every error can be recovered.

    class Exception extends Error {}

    function handleAll(
      actions : () => void,
      error_handling_actions : () => void,
      exception_handling_actions : () => void)
    {
      try {
        actions()
      }
      catch (x) {
        if (x instanceof Exception)
          exception_handling_actions()
        else if (x instanceof Error)
          error_handling_actions()
      }
    }
