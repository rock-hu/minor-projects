.. _Modules and Compilation Units:

Compilation Units, Packages, and Modules
########################################

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Programs are structured as sequences of elements ready for compilation, i.e.,
compilation units. Each compilation unit creates its own scope (see
:ref:`Scopes`). The compilation unitâ€™s variables, functions, classes,
interfaces, or other declarations are only accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`)
within such scope if not explicitly exported.

A variable, function, class, interface, or other declarations exported from 
some compilation unit must be imported first by the compilation unit that
needs to use them. 

.. Only exported declarations are available for the 3rd party tools and programs written in other programming languages.

There are three kinds of compilation units:

- *Separate modules* (discussed below),
- *Declaration modules* (discussed in detail in :ref:`Declaration Modules`), and
- *Packages* (discussed in detail in :ref:`Packages`).

.. code-block:: abnf

    compilationUnit:
        separateModuleDeclaration
        | packageDeclaration
        | declarationModule
        ;

    packageDeclaration:
        packageModule+
        ;

All modules (both separate modules and packages) are stored in a file
system or a database (see :ref:`Compilation Units in Host System`).

.. index::
   compilation unit
   scope
   variable
   function
   class
   interface

.. _Separate Modules:

Separate Modules
****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A *separate module* is a module without a package header. A *separate module*
can optionally consist of the following four parts:

#. Import directives that enable referring imported declarations in a module;

#. Top-level declarations;

#. Top-level statements; and

#. Re-export directives.


.. code-block:: abnf

    separateModuleDeclaration:
        importDirective* (topDeclaration | topLevelStatements | exportDirective)*
        ;

Every module can directly use all exported entities from the core packages of
the standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library Usage`).

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // Hello, world! module
    function main() {
      console.log("Hello, world!") // console is defined in the standard library
    }

.. index::
   separate module
   package header
   import directive
   imported declaration
   module
   top-level declaration
   top-level statement
   re-export directive
   import
   predefined package
   standard library
   entity
   access
   simple name
   console variable

.. _Separate Module Initializer:

Separate Module Initializer
***************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

If used for import, a *separate module* is initialized only once with the
details listed in :ref:`Compilation Unit Initialization`. The initialization process
is performed in the following steps:

- If the separate module has variable or constant declarations (see
  :ref:`Variable and Constant Declarations`), then their initializers are
  executed to ensure that they all have valid initial values;
- If the separate module has top-level statements (see :ref:`Top-Level Statements`),
  then they are also executed.

.. _Compilation Units in Host System:

Compilation Units in Host System
**********************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Modules and packages are created and stored in a manner determined by the
host system. The exact manner modules and packages are stored in a file
system is determined by a particular implementation of the compiler and other
tools.

In a simple implementation:

-  A module (package module) is stored in a single file.

-  Files that correspond to a package module are stored in a single folder.

-  A folder can store several separate modules (one source file to contain a
   separate module or a package module).

-  A folder that stores a single package must not contain separate module
   files or package modules from other packages.

.. index::

.. _Import Directives:

Import Directives
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Import directives make entities exported from other compilation units (see
also :ref:`Declaration Modules`) available for use in the current compilation
unit by using different binding forms.

An import declaration has two parts as follows:

-  Import path that determines a compilation unit to import from;

-  Import binding that defines what entities, and in what form---qualified
   or unqualified---the current compilation unit can use.

Alternatively, a module can be imported without binding simply in order to
run the initialization code.

.. index::
   import directive
   compilation unit
   export
   entity
   binding
   module
   import declaration
   import path
   import binding
   qualified form
   unqualified form

.. code-block:: abnf

    importDirective:
        'import' 
        (allBinding|selectiveBindigns|defaultBinding|typeBinding 'from')?
        importPath
        ;

    allBinding:
        '*' bindingAlias
        ;

    selectiveBindigns:
        '{' nameBinding (',' nameBinding)* '}'
        ;

    defaultBinding:
        identifier | ( '{' 'default' 'as' identifier '}' )
        ;

    typeBinding:
        'type' selectiveBindigns
        ;

    nameBinding:
        qualifiedName bindingAlias?
        ;

    bindingAlias:
        'as' identifier
        ;

    importPath:
        StringLiteral
        ;

Each binding adds a declaration or declarations to the scope of a module
or a package (see :ref:`Scopes`). Any declaration added so must be
distinguishable in the declaration scope (see
:ref:`Distinguishable Declarations`). A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

-  A declaration added to the scope of a module or a package by a binding is
   not distinguishable;
-  ``importPath`` refers to the file the current module is stored in.


**Note**: Import directives are handled by the compiler during compilation, and
have no effect during program execution.

.. _Bind All with Qualified Access:

Bind All with Qualified Access
==============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The import binding ``* as A`` binds the single named entity *A* to the
declaration scope of the current module.

A qualified name consisting of *A* and the name of entity ``A.name`` is used
to access any entity exported from the compilation unit as defined by the
*import path*.

+---------------------------------+--+-------------------------------+
| **Import**                      |  | **Usage**                     |
+=================================+==+===============================+
|                                                                    |
+---------------------------------+--+-------------------------------+
| .. code-block:: typescript      |  | .. code-block:: typescript    |
|                                 |  |                               |
|     import * as Math from "..." |  |     let x = Math.sin(1.0)     |
+---------------------------------+--+-------------------------------+

This form of import is recommended because it simplifies the reading and
understanding of the source code when all exported entities are prefixed with
the name of the imported compilation unit.

.. index::
   import binding
   qualified access
   named entity
   declaration scope
   module
   qualified name
   entity
   name
   access
   export
   compilation unit
   import path
   source code

.. _Simple Name Binding:

Simple Name Binding
===================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The import binding ``qualifiedName`` has two cases as follows:

-  A simple name (like ``foo``); or

-  A name containing several identifiers (like ``A.foo``).


The import binding ``ident`` binds an exported entity with the name ``ident``
to the declaration scope of the current module. The name ``ident`` can only
correspond to several entities, where ``ident`` denotes several overloaded
functions (see :ref:`Function and Method Overloading`).

The import binding ``ident as A`` binds an exported entity (entities) with the
name *A* to the declaration scope of the current module.

The bound entity is not accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) as ``ident`` because
this binding does not bind ``ident``. It is shown in the following module:

.. index::
   import binding
   simple name
   identifier
   export
   name
   declaration scope
   overloaded function
   entity
   access
   bound entity
   binding

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export const PI = 3.14
    export function sin(d: number): number {}

The import path of the module is now irrelevant:

.. _Several Bindings for One Import Path:

Several Bindings for One Import Path
====================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The same bound entities can use the following:

- Several import bindings,
- One import directive, or several import directives with the same import path:


+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                 |                                   |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                 | .. code-block:: typescript        |
| In one import directive         |                                   |
|                                 |     import {sin, cos} from "..."  |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                 | .. code-block:: typescript        |
| In several import directives    |                                   |
|                                 |     import {sin} from "..."       |
|                                 |     import {cos} from "..."       |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

No conflict occurs in the above example, because the import bindings
define disjoint sets of names.

The order of import bindings in an import declaration has no influence
on the outcome of the import.

The rules below prescribe what names must be used to add bound entities
to the declaration scope of the current module if multiple bindings are
applied to a single name:

.. index::
   import binding
   bound entity
   import directive
   import path
   import declaration
   import outcome
   declaration scope

+-----------------------------+----------------------------+------------------------------+
| **Case**                    | **Sample**                 | **Rule**                     |

.. _Default Import Binding:

Default Import Binding
======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Default import binding allows importing a declaration exported from some
module as default export. Knowing the actual name of the declaration is not
required as the new name is given at importing.
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if another form of import is used to
import an entity initially exported as default.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    import DefaultExportedItemBindedName from ".../someFile"
    import {default as DefaultExportedItemNewName} from  ".../someFile"

      let v1 = new DefaultExportedItemBindedName()
      // instance of class 'SomeClass' to be created here
      let v2 = new DefaultExportedItemNewName()
      // instance of class 'SomeClass' to be created here
    }

.. _Type Binding:

Type Binding
============

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Type import binding allows importing only the type declarations exported from
a module or a package. These declarations can be exported normally, or by
using the *export type* form. The difference between *import* and
*import type* is that the former imports all exported top-level declarations,
and the latter imports only exported types.

.. _Import with No Binding:

Import with No Binding
======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

Import with No Binding allows initializing the imported module or package
intialization code right before the code of the current module starts:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // File module.sts
    console.log ("Module initialization code")

    // Folder PackageFolder
       // File package.sts
       package P
       console.log ("Package initialization code")

    // MainProgram.sts

    import "./module.sts"
    import "./PackageFolder"
    console.log ("MainProgram code")

The output of Import with No Binding is as follows:

- Module initialization code;
- Package initialization code; or
- MainProgram code.

.. _Import Path:

Import Path
===========

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Import path is a string literal---represented as a combination of the
slash character '``/``' and a sequence alpha-numeric characters---that
determines how an imported compilation unit must be placed.

The slash character '``/``' is used in import paths irrespective of the host
system. The backslash character is not used in this context.

In most file systems, an import path looks like a file path. *Relative* (see
below) and *non-relative* import paths have different *resolutions* that map
the import path to a file path of the host system.

The compiler uses the following rule to define the kind of imported
compilation units, and the exact placement of the source code:

-  If import path refers to a folder denoted by the last name in the resolved
   file path, then the compiler imports the package that resides in the
   folder. The source code of the package is all the |LANG| source files in
   the folder.

-  Otherwise, the compiler imports the module that the import path refers to.
   The source code of the module is the file with the extension provided
   within the import path, or---if none is so provided---appended by the
   compiler.


.. index::
   import binding
   import path
   string literal
   compilation unit
   file system
   file path
   relative import path
   non-relative import path
   resolution
   host system
   source code
   package
   module
   folder
   extension
   resolving
   filename

A *relative import path* starts with '``./``' or '``../``' as in the following
examples:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    "./components/entry"
    "../constants/http"

Resolving a *relative import* is relative to the importing file. *Relative
import* is used on compilation units to maintain their relative location.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    import * as Utils from "./mytreeutils"

Other import paths are *non-relative* as in the examples below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    "/net/http"
    "std/components/treemap"

Resolving a *non-relative path* depends on the compilation environment. The
definition of the compiler environment can be particularly provided in a
configuration file or environment variables.

The *base URL* setting is used to resolve a path that starts with '/'.
*Path mapping* is used in all other cases. Resolution details depend on
the implementation.

For example, the compilation configuration file can contain the following lines:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    "baseUrl": "/home/project",
    "paths": {
        "std": "/arkts/stdlib"
    }

In the example above, ``/net/http`` is resolved to ``/home/project/net/http``,
and ``std/components/treemap`` to ``/arkts/stdlib/components/treemap``.

File name, placement, and format are implementation-specific.

    todo: now core, containers, math and time are also imported because of stdlib internal dependencies

    todo: add escompat to spec and default

All entities exported from the core packages of the standard library (see
:ref:`Standard Library`) are accessible  as simple names (see :ref:`Accessible`)
in any compilation unit.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function main() {

      let myException = new Exception { ... }
        // class 'Exception' is defined in the standard library

.. _Declaration Modules:

Declaration Modules
*******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A *declaration module* is a special kind of compilation units that can be
imported by using :ref:`Import Directives`. A declaration module contains
:ref:`Ambient Declarations` and :ref:`Type Alias Declaration` only.

Ambient declarations defined in the declaration module must be fully declared
elsewhere.

.. code-block:: abnf

    declarationModule:
        importDirective* 
        ( 'export'? ambientDeclaration
        | 'export'? typeAlias
        | selectiveExportDirective
        )*
        ;

The following example shows how ambient functions can be declared and exported:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    declare function foo()
    export declare function goo()
    export { foo }

Optional usage of the keyword ``export`` means that a particular declaration
is used by other exported declarations. However, it is not exported on its own
and cannot be used by modules that import this declaration module:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   // module with implementation
   class A {} // It is not exported
   export class B {
     public a: A = new A // the field is exported but its type is not
   }
   export function process_field (p: A) {}

   // declaration module should look like
   declare class A {}
   export declare class B {
     public a: A // the field is exported but its type is not
   }
   export function process_field (p: A)

   // Module which uses B and process_field
   import {* as m} from "path_to_declaration_module"

   let b = new m.B  // B instance is created
   m.process_field (b.a) // exported field is passed to function as an argument

   let a = new m.A // compile-time error as A is not exported



The exact manner declaration modules are stored in the file system, and how
they differ from separate modules, is determined by a particular implementation.

.. _Compilation Unit Initialization:

Compilation Unit Initialization
*******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A *compilation unit* is a separate module (see :ref:`Separate Module Initializer`)
or a package (see :ref:`Package Initializer`) that is initialized once before
the first use of an entity (function, variable, or type) exported from the
compilation unit.
If a compilation unit has any import directive (see :ref:`Import Directives`)
but the imported entities are not actually used, then the imported compilation
unit (separate or package) is initialized before the entry point (see
:ref:`Program Entry Point`) code starts.
If different compilation units are not connected by import, then the order
of initialization of the compilation units is not determined.
If there is a cyclic dependency between top-level variable declarations, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. code-block-meta:
   expect-cte:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // Source file 1
    import {x} from "Source file 2"
    let y = x // y uses x for its initialization


    // Source file 2
    import {y} from "Source file 1"
    let x = y // x uses y for its initialization

.. _Top-Level Declarations:

Top-Level Declarations
**********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Top-level declarations* declare top-level types (``class``, ``interface``,
or ``enum``), top-level variables, constants, or functions. Top-level
declarations can be exported.

.. code-block:: abnf

    topDeclaration:
        ('export' 'default'?)?
        ( typeDeclaration
        | variableDeclarations
        | constantDeclarations
        | functionDeclaration
        | extensionFunctionDeclaration
        )
        ;

|

.. _Exported Declarations:

Exported Declarations
=====================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Top-level declarations can use export modifiers that make the declarations
accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) in other compilation units by using import
(see :ref:`Import Directives`). The declarations not marked as exported can be
used only inside the compilation unit they are declared in.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export class Point {}
    export let Origin = new Point(0, 0)
    export function Distance(p1: Point, p2: Point): number {
      // ...
    }

In addition, only one top-level declaration can be exported by using the default
export scheme. It allows specifying no declared name when importing (see
:ref:`Default Import Binding` for details). A :index:`compile-time error`
occurs if more than one top-level declaration is marked as ``default``.

.. code-block-meta:


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export default let PI = 3.141592653589

.. _Export Directives:

Export Directives
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The *export directive* allows the following:

-  Specifying a selective list of exported declarations with optional
   renaming; or
-  Specifying a name of one declaration; or
-  Exporting a type; or
-  Re-exporting declarations from other compilation units.


.. code-block:: abnf

    exportDirective:
        selectiveExportDirective 
        | singleExportDirective 
        | exportTypeDirective 
        | reExportDirective
        ;

.. index::
   export directive
   exported declaration

|

.. _Selective Export Directive:

Selective Export Directive
==========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Top-level declarations can be made *exported* by using a selective export
directive. The selective export directive provides an explicit list of names
of the declarations to be exported. Optional renaming allows having the
declarations exported with new names.

.. code-block:: abnf

    selectiveExportDirective:
        'export' selectiveBindigns
        ;

A selective export directive uses the same *selective bindings* as an import
directive:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export { d1, d2 as d3}

The above directive exports 'd1' by its name, and 'd2' as 'd3'. The name 'd2'
is not accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) in the modules that import this
module.

.. index::
   selective export directive

.. _Single Export Directive:

Single Export Directive
=======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A single export directive allows specifying the declaration to be exported from
the current compilation unit by using the declaration's own name. The directive
in the example below exports variable 'v' by its name:

.. code-block:: abnf

    singleExportDirective:
        'export' identifier
        ;


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export v
    let v = 1


|

.. _Export Type Directive:

Export Type Directive
=====================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

In addition to export that is attached to some declaration, the *export type*
directive can be used in order to do the following:

-  Export *as a type* a particular class or interface already declared; or
-  Export an already declared type under a different name.

The appropriate syntax is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    exportTypeDirective:
        'export' 'type' selectiveBindigns
        ;

If a class or an interface is exported in this manner, then its usage is
limited similarly to the limitations described for *import type* directives
(see :ref:`Type Binding`).

If a class or interface is declared exported, but *export type* is applied
to the same class or interface name, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.
This situation is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class A {}

    export type {A}  // export already declared class type

    export type MyA = A // name MyA is declared and exported

    export type {MyA} // compile-time error as MyA was already exported

|

.. _Re-Export Directive:

Re-Export Directive
===================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

In addition to exporting what is declared in the module, it is possible to
re-export declarations that are part of other modules' export. Only
limited re-export possibilities are currently supported.

It is possible to re-export a particular declaration or all declarations
from a module. When re-exporting, new names can be given. This action is
similar to importing but with the opposite direction. The appropriate grammar
is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    reExportDirective:
        'export' ('*' | selectiveBindigns) 'from' importPath
        ;

An ``importPath`` cannot refer to the file the current module is stored in.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.


The re-exporting practice is represented in the following examples:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export * from "path_to_the_module" // re-export all exported declarations
    export { d1, d2 as d3} from "path_to_the_module"
       // re-export particular declarations some under new name

.. index::
   re-export
   re-export directive
   re-export declaration
   module



.. _Top-Level Statements:

Top-Level Statements
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A separate module can contain sequences of statements that logically
comprise one sequence of statements:

.. code-block:: abnf

    topLevelStatements:
        statement*
        ;

A module can contain any number of top-level statements that logically
merge into a single sequence in the textual order:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      statements_1
      /* top-declarations */
      statements_2

The sequence above is equal to the following:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      /* top-declarations */
      statements_1; statements_2

.. index::
   separate module
   statement
   top-level statement
   sequence

- If a separate module is imported by some other module, then the semantics of
  top-level statements is to initialize the imported module. It means that all
  top-level statements are executed only once before a call to any other
  function, or before the access to any top-level variable of the separate
  module.
- If a separate module is used as a program, then top-level statements are used
  as a program entry point (see :ref:`Program Entry Point`). Note that an empty
  set of top-level statements implies an empty program entry point that does
  nothing. If the separate module has the ``main`` function, then it is
  executed after the execution of the top-level statements. 

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      // Source file A
      { // Block form
        console.log ("A.top-level statements")
      }

      // Source file B
      import * as A from "Source file A "
      function main () {
         console.log ("B.main")
      }

The output is as follows:

A. Top-level statements,
B. Main.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      // One source file
      console.log ("A.Top-level statements")
      function main () {
         console.log ("B.main")
      }

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a top-level statement contains a
return statement (:ref:`Expression Statements`).

.. index::
   top-level statement

   function
   access
   top-level variable

.. _Program Entry Point:

Program Entry Point
*******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Separate modules can act as programs (applications). The two kinds of program
(application) entry points are as follows:

- Top-level statements (see :ref:`Top-Level Statements`);
- Top-level ``main`` function (see below).

Thus, a separate module can have:

- Sole top-level ``main`` function (that is the entry point);
- Sole top-level statements (the first statement in the top-level statements
  is the entry point);
- Both top-level statements and ``main`` function (same as above, plus ``main``
  is called after the top-level statements execution is completed).

A top-level ``main`` function must have either no parameters, or one
parameter of string type ``[]`` that provides access to the arguments of
program command-line. Its return type is either ``void`` (see :ref:`Type void`)
or ``int``. No overloading is allowed for an entry point function.

Different forms of valid and invalid entry points are represented in the example
below:

.. code-block-meta:
   expect-cte:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function main() {
      // Option 1: a return type is inferred from the body of main().
      // It will be 'int' if the body has 'return' with the integer expression
      // and 'void' if no return at all in the body
    }

    function main(): void {
      // Option 2: explicit :void - no return in the function body required
    }

    function main(): int {
      // Option 3: explicit :int - return is required
      return 0
    }

    function main(): string { // compile-time error: incorrect main signature
      return ""
    }

    function main(p: number) { // compile-time error: incorrect main signature
    }

    // Option 4: top-level statement is the entry point
    console.log ("Hello, world!")

.. _Program Exit:

Program Exit
************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Separate modules can act as programs (applications). Thus, a separate module
can have:

- Only a top-level ``main`` function;
- Only top-level statements;
- Both top-level statements and ``main`` function.

A program exit takes place when:

- All top-level statements and statements of the ``main`` function body, if any,
  complete normally.
- An unhandled error or exception (see :ref:`Error Handling`, :ref:`Exceptions`)
  occurs during the program execution.

In both cases, the control is passed to the |LANG| runtime system, which ensures
that all coroutines (see :ref:`Coroutines`) created during the program execution
are terminated.

If an unhandled error or exception occur, then proper diagnostics is displayed.

This is the end of the program exit process.
