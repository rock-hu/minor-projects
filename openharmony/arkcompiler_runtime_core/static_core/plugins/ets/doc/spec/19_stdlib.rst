The Standard Library of the |LANG| language defines the required set of types,
variables, constants, functions, and annotations that provide APIs for effective
and convenient programming.

The Standard Library has two parts: the common part provides |TS| compatibility,
and the |LANG|-specific part adds more advanced features.

A detailed description of all elements of the standard library is covered in
a separate document that is part of the |LANG| distribution package.
