How to Use System ArkTS
=======================

The main goal of "System |LANG|" is to help developers make their ArkTS code
more efficient.

System ArkTS provides tips to focus on the performance. System |LANG| gives
an appropriate warning and suggests what other features a developer can use
to rewrite the code.

All "System |LANG|" warnings are divided into the following categories:

#. **Subset warnings**: Part of |LANG| that is common with |TS|.
   The original code requires modifications that keep the code within the Common
   Subset with |TS|.
#. **Non-subset warnings**: Part of |LANG| that differs from |TS|.
   The original code requires modifications that are not within the Common
   Subset with |TS|.

Possible options are as follows:

* **ets-subset-warnings**              : Enable all ETS-warnings to keep the code in subset with |TS|.
* **ets-non-subset-warnings**          : Enable all ETS-warnings that are not in subset with |TS|.
* **ets-warnings-all**                 : Enable all ETS-warnings in "System |LANG|".
* **ets-werror**                       : Treat all enabled ETS-warnings as errors.

* **ets-implicit-boxing-unboxing**     : Check if a program contains implicit boxing or unboxing. ETS Subset Warning.
* **ets-boost-equality-expression**    : Suggest boosting equality expressions. ETS Subset Warning.
* **ets-remove-async**                 : Suggest replacing async functions with coroutines. ETS Non-subset Warning.
* **ets-suggest-final**                : Suggest using the keyword ``final``. ETS Non-subset Warning.
* **ets-remove-lambda**                : Suggestions to replace lambda with regular functions. ETS Subset Warning.


To see "System |LANG|" warnings, add "System |LANG|" options from the list above while compiling.

Usage Example
-------------

1. Write some |LANG| code. E.g., you have the following chunk of code:

.. code-block:: typescript

    class A {
        foo(): String {
            return "foo";
        };
    }

    class K extends A  {
        foo_to_suggest(): void {};
        override foo(): String {
            return "overridden_foo";
        }
    }

2. Specify one option to the compiler. E.g., add ``--ets-suggest-final`` or ``--ets-suggest-final=true``;
3. Compile your file or project with the options so added;
4. Look through the ETS-Warnings in the output. For the code in the example
   above, "System |LANG|" gives the following warnings:

    * ``ETS Warning: Suggest 'final' modifier for class 'K'. [usage.sts:7:11]``

    * ``ETS Warning: Suggest 'final' modifier for method 'foo_to_suggest'. [usage.sts:8:23]``

    * ``ETS Warning: Suggest 'final' modifier for method 'foo'. [usage.sts:9:21]``

5. Rewrite the code as suggested by "System |LANG|". After rewriting |LANG|,
   the code is as follows:

.. code:: typescript

    // Important! Shown feature is non-subset with TypeScript.
    class A {
        foo(): String {
            return "foo";
        };
    }

    final class K extends A {
        final foo_to_suggest(): void {};
        final override foo(): String {
            return "overridden_foo";
        }
    }

|

``ets-werror`` Usage Example
----------------------------

This section explains handling "System |LANG|" warnings as errors by
continuing the example as above:

1. Write some |LANG| code. E.g., you have the following chunk of code:

.. code-block:: typescript

    class I { // No final - inheritance }

    class A extends I { // Suggest final }

2. Specify one option to the compiler and enable ``ets-werror``. E.g., add ``--ets-suggest-final --ets-werror``;
3. Compile your file or project with the options so added, and a compile-time error occurs;
4. Look through the ETS-Warnings in the output. For the code in the example
   above, "System |LANG|" gives the following warnings:

    * ``System ArkTS. Warning treated as error: Suggest 'final' modifier for class [werror.sts:4:11]``

5. Rewrite the code as suggested by "System |LANG|". After rewriting |LANG|,
   the code is as follows:

.. code:: typescript


    class I { // No final - inheritance }

    final class A extends I { }

|

Status of not implemented features
-----------------------------------

System |LANG| team is working to provide |LANG| developers even more
performance-related tips and suggestions. In the near future we are to
investigate into the following possible performance leaks:

* Union usage;
* Nullable types;
* Rest parameters check vs. Array usage
* Non-throwing function.

See status updates in the following releases.
