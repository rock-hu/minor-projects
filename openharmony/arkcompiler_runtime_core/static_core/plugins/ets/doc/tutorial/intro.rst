Welcome to the tutorial for |LANG|, a |TS|-based programming language
designed specifically to build high-performance mobile applications!

|LANG| is optimized to provide better performance and efficiency, while still
maintaining the familiar syntax of |TS|.

As mobile devices continue to become more prevalent in our daily lives,
there is a growing need for programming languages optimized for the
mobile environment. Many current programming languages were not designed with
mobile devices in mind, resulting in slow and inefficient applications that
drain battery life. |LANG| has been specifically designed to address such concerns
by prioritizing higher execution efficiency.

|LANG| is based on the popular programming language |TS| that extends
|JS| by adding type definitions. |TS| is well-loved by many developers as it
provides a more structured approach to coding in |JS|. |LANG| aims to
keep the look and feel of |TS| to enable a seamless transition for the existing
|TS| developers, and to let mobile developers learn |LANG| quickly.

One of the key features of |LANG| is its focus on low runtime overhead.
|LANG| imposes stricter limitations on the |TS|'s dynamically typed features,
reducing runtime overhead, and allowing faster execution. As dynamically typed
features are eliminated from the language, |LANG| code can be compiled
ahead-of-time more efficiently, resulting in faster application startup and
lower power consumption.

Interoperability with |JS| was a critical consideration in the |LANG| language
design. Many mobile app developers already have the |TS| and |JS| code and
libraries they would want to reuse. |LANG| has been designed for seamless |JS|
interoperability, making it easy for the developers to integrate the |JS| code
into their applications, and vice versa, and allowing the developers to leverage
the power of the new language by using their existing codebases and libraries.

To ensure the best experience for UI app development for OpenHarmony ecosystem,
|LANG| provides support for |UIFW|, including its declarative syntax, and other
features. Since this feature is outside the scope of the "stock" |TS|, a verbose
|UIFW| example is provided in a separate chapter.

This tutorial guides developers through the core features, syntax, and best
practices of |LANG|. After reading this tutorial through the end, a developer
will be able to build performant and efficient mobile applications in |LANG|.
