    A covariant type argument (or a wildcard with an upper bound) is signified by the following syntax, where T is a typeReference:
    out T
    It restricts available methods so it is only allowed to access methods that do not use T or do use ones with T in out-positions only.
    Consequently, a contravariant type argument (or a wildcard with a lower bound) is signified by the following syntax, where T is a typeReference:
    in T
    It restricts available methods so it is only allowed to access methods that do not use T or do use ones with T in in-positions only.
