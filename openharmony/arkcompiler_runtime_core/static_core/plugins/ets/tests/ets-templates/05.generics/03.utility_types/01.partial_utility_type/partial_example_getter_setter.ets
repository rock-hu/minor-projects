    If class T has a user-defined getter, setter, or both, then none of those is called when object literal is used with
    Partial<T> variables. Object literal has its own built-in getters and setters to modify its variables. It is represented
    in the example below:

let i: int = 0

interface I {
  property: number
}

class A implements I {
  set property(property: number) { i+=1 }
  get property(): number { i+=10; return this.property }
}

function foo (partial: Partial<A>) {
  partial.property = 42 // setter to be called
  return partial.property // getter to be called
}

function main() {
  assertEQ( foo({property: 1}), 42) // No getter or setter from class A is called
  // 42 is printed as object literal has its own setter and getter
  assertEQ( i, 0 )
