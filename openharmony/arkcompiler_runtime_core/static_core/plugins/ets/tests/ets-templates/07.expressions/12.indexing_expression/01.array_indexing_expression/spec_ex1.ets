    It is essential that, if type T is a reference type, then the fields of array elements
    can be changed by changing the resultant variable fields.
    An illustration is given in the example below:
---*/

function main() {
    let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    assertTrue( names[1] == "Bob" )
    // console.log(name[1]) // prints Bob
    names[1] = "Martin"
    assertTrue( names[1] == "Martin" )
    // console.log(name[1]) // prints Martin
}
