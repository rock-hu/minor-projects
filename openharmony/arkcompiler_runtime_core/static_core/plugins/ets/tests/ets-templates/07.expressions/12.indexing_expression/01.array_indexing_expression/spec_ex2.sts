    It is essential that, if type T is a reference type, then the fields of array elements
    can be changed by changing the resultant variable fields.
    An illustration is given in the example below:
---*/

class RefType {
    field: number = 666
}

function main() {
    const objects: RefType[] = [new RefType(), new RefType()]
    const object = objects[1]
    object.field = 777            // change the field in the array element
    assert objects[0].field == 666
    assert objects[1].field == 777
    // console.log(objects[0].filed) // prints 666
    // console.log(objects[1].filed) // prints 777
}
