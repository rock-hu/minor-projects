    If the left-hand operand is an array access expression (ยง7.12), possibly enclosed in one or more pairs of parentheses, then:
    - First, the array reference subexpression of the left-hand operand is evaluated.
    If this evaluation completes abruptly, then the assignment expression completes
    abruptly for the same reason; the index subexpression and the right-hand operand
    are not evaluated and no assignment occurs.
