desc: Overload two methods, two inherited.
assert: If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by a class, or one declared and one inherited) have the same name but signatures that are not override-equivalent, then the method name is said to be overloaded. This fact causes no difficulty and never of itself results in a compile-time error.
