desc: Declaring constructor with return statement with expression.
assert: >-
    A return statement may be used in the body of a constructor if it does not include an expression.
    Except for the possibility of explicit constructor invocations, and the prohibition on explicitly
    returning a value, the body of a constructor is like the body of a method.
