    If used for import, a separate module is initialized only once with the details listed in Compilation Unit Initialization.
    The initialization process is performed in the following steps
    • If the separate module has variable or constant declarations (see Variable and Constant Declarations), then their
      initializers are executed to ensure that they all have valid initial values
    • If the separate module has top-level statements (see Top-Level Statements), then they are also executed.
