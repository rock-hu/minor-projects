    Variance is how subtyping between class types relates to subtyping between class member signatures
    (types of parameters, return type). Variance can be of three kinds:
    - Invariance,
    - Covariance, and
    - Contravariance.
    Contravariance is the ability to use a type that is more general than originally specified.

    contravariance for parameter types: Base is a supertype for Derived
