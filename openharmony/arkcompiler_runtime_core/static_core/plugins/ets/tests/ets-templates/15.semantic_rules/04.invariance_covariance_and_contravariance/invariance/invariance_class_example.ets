    Variance is how subtyping between class types relates to subtyping between class member signatures
    (types of parameters, return type). Variance can be of three kinds:
    - Invariance,
    - Covariance, and
    - Contravariance.
    Invariance refers to the ability to use the originally-specified type as a derived one.
