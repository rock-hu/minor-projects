    There could be cases when the type of an entity (mostly local variables)
    is a union type and in the particular context of the program the compiler
    can narrow (smart cast) the static type to a more precise type (smart type)
    and allow operations which are specific to such narrowed type.

function foo(p: number|number[]|undefined): number {
    if (p instanceof Number) {

        return 1
    } else if (p instanceof number[]) {
        num = p.length  // field access without cast
        return 2
