          There are two cases of type override-compatibility, as types are used as either parameter types,
          or return types. For each case there are six kinds of types

          - Type parameter

          Every type is override-compatible with itself (see Invariance).

          The following rule applies in case of generics

          - Derived class must have type parameter constraints to be type-compatible (see Type Compatibility) with the
          respective type parameter constraint in the base type;
          - Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
