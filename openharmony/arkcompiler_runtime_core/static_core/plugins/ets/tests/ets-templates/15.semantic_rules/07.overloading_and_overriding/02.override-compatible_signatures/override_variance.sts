          There are two cases of type override-compatibility, as types are used as either parameter types,
          or return types. For each case there are five kinds of types:
          • Class/interface type;
          • Function type;
          • Primitive type;
          • Array type; and
          • Tuple type.

          Every type is override-compatible with itself, and that is a case of invariance.
