    A function can be declared in, or imported to a scope.
    The semantic check for these functions is as follows:
    • If signatures of functions are overload-equivalent, then a compile-time error occurs.
    • Otherwise, overloading is valid.
    More details can be found in Function Overloading and in Import and Overloading of Function Names.
