    A function can be declared in or imported to the scope. It is not allowed to mix functions declared and imported, or
    imported from different compilation units to prevent uncontrolled overloading. To be more precise, a compile-time
    error occurs for functions with the same name, if
    • Functions are imported from different compilation units;
    • Some functions are imported and others are declared.
