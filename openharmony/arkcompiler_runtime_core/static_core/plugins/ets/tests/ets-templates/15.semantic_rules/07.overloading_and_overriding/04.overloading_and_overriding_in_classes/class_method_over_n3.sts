    An instance method is defined in a subclass with the same name as the instance method in a superclass.
    If signatures are override-compatible, then overriding is used. Otherwise, overloading is used.

    A static method is defined in a subclass with the same name as the static method in a superclass.
    If signatures are overload-equivalent, then the static method in the subclass hides the previous static method.
