# A very simple wrapper around clang-format:
# Compare the original file with what clang-format thinks it should
# look like and output corresponding diff. Exit with the same code as diff.
#
# USAGE:
# scripts/run-clang-format /path/to/clang-format /path/to/checked/file
#
# The only reason of this script's existence is to avoid messing with
# escaping special chatracters in CMake files.
