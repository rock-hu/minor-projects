    # Section description

    # This section defines used environment variables for hzjsvm workflow
    # Values should be set either as environment variables before the runner.sh starts
    # or explicitly in this yaml configuration file - uncomment the variable and set the correct value.

    # Setting as environment value has higher priority then values here.
    # If you want to use values in this config - be sure that the mentioned environment
    # variables not set.

    # All listed here environment variables are used as a full or partial values of
    # some properties. These properties are declared in workflow or test-suite files
    # and should not be touched.
    # But some properties can be set through CLI - in such cases the specified environment
    # variables are not used. The CLI option has higher priority as it sets the property directly.

    # So, shortly to specify one property either use environment variable or CLI option.
    # Do NOT mix them.
