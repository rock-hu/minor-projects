/* We are using the fact that on every operating system some of the process's virtual memory space
   is unavailable for allocation -- for example, it may be reserved for kernel memory.

   For Linux:
       https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/address-space.html

       Linux is using a split address space for 32 bit systems, although in the past there
       were options for supporting 4/4s split or dedicated kernel address space (on those
       architecture that supports it, e.g. x86). Linux always uses split address space for 64 bit systems.

       [For 32-bit Linux, the split is usually 3/1, i.e. 0x00000000-0xc0000000 is user space,
       0xc0000000-0xffffffff is kernel space]

   For Windows: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/virtual-address-spaces

       For a 32-bit process, the virtual address space is usually the 2-gigabyte range 0x00000000
       through 0x7FFFFFFF.
       For a 64-bit process on 64-bit Windows, the virtual address space is the 128-terabyte range
       0x000'00000000 through 0x7FFF'FFFFFFFF.
