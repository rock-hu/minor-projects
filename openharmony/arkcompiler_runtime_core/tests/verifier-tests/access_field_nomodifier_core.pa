# access to non-public field of a foreign class:
# - it must fail in Java if the class is nor inherited by current class, nor stays in the same package
# - in non-Java language context it is OK

# Similar Java test to fail verification:
#
# public class Test {
#     public static int test() {
#         // Expected VerificationError: Access to the package protected object field is prohibited.
#         return Test2.value;

# package pckg;
# class Test2 {
#     static int value;
