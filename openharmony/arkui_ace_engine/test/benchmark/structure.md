## components
- Same build structure as unit test. Pipeline, rendering, animations are mocked.
- Benchmarks performance of component code: creation and layout.
- Independent from other libraries. Can compile with native x86 toolchain.

## render
- Benchmarks RosenRenderContext, core paths like RenderContext creation, SyncGeometryNode, render property update.
