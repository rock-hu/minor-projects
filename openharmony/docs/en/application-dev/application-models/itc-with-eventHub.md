# Using EventHub for Intra-Thread Communication


[EventHub](../reference/apis-ability-kit/js-apis-inner-application-eventHub.md) provides APIs for sending and processing events in threads, including subscribing to, unsubscribing from, and triggering events. [Using EventHub for Data Synchronization](uiability-data-sync-with-ui.md#using-eventhub-for-data-synchronization) describes the development procedure by using data synchronization between the UIAbility component and the UI as an example.
