# Buffer and FastBuffer

## When to Use

The Buffer and FastBuffer modules, built on memory management mechanisms, abstract memory regions into logical objects that can be read, written, and modified, aiming to provide an efficient interface for handling binary data. Each Buffer instance is a contiguous sequence of bytes. It supports the creation of custom-sized memory blocks, which facilitates the storage and manipulation of various types of serialized data.

The Buffer and FastBuffer modules are primarily used in the following scenarios:

1. **Large data transfers**: When transmitting large volumes of data, like binary files, database records, or network packets, buffers serve as efficient containers for data storage and processing, reducing memory overhead and enhancing transfer efficiency.

2. **Image and audio processing**: Buffers help you manipulate pixel and sample data during image encoding/decoding and audio stream processing, ensuring data integrity.

3. **Binary data operation**: The Buffer module offers a stable interface for parsing and manipulating binary data.

## Buffer

The core functionalities of the Buffer module are as follows:

1. **Memory allocation**: You can initialize a buffer with a specified size, resulting in a fixed memory capacity upon creation.

2. **Data read/write and copying**: You can access bytes within a buffer by index, read and write data byte-by-byte, and copy parts of a buffer to another buffer or array.

3. **Conversion operations**: Methods are provided for converting buffers to and from basic types such as Uint8Array and string, catering to diverse data processing needs.

4. **Memory manipulation**: Buffers can be sliced, spliced, and concatenated, making it easier to manage and process data streams.

## FastBuffer

FastBuffer is a high-performance binary data container specifically designed for storing and processing fixed-length byte sequences. Compared with the Buffer module, FastBuffer offers significant advantages in efficiency and read/write speed.

When initializing a FastBuffer with parameters such as number, FastBuffer, Uint8Array, ArrayBuffer, Array\<number>, or string, it is highly recommended for handling large volumes of binary data, such as in image processing and file uploads/downloads.

The core functionalities of the FastBuffer module are as follows:

1. **Memory allocation**: You can initialize a buffer with a specified size, limited by uint32, resulting in a fixed memory capacity upon creation.

2. **Data read/write and copying**: You can access bytes within a buffer by index, read and write data byte-by-byte, and copy parts of a FastBuffer to another FastBuffer or array.

3. **Conversion operations**: Methods are provided for converting FastBuffers to and from basic types such as Uint8Array and string, catering to diverse data processing needs.

4. **Memory manipulation**: FastBuffers can be sliced, spliced, and concatenated, making it easier to manage and process data streams.
