The Media Kit (media service) provides <!--RP1-->[AVPlayer]() and [AVRecorder]()<!--RP1End--> for playing and recording audio and video.

The Media Kit development guide describes the development methods in various scenarios involving audio and video playback and recording, and guides developers how to use the audio and video APIs provided by the system to implement corresponding functions. <!--RP2--> For example, SoundPool is used to implement a simple prompt tone. When the device receives a new message, it emits a short "drip" sound. Use the AVPlayer to implement the music player and play a piece of music cyclically. <!--RP2End-->
