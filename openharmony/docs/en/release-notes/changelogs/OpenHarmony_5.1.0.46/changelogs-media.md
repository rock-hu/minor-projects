## cl.media.1 Change in Screenshot API Called by the System Screen Recording Application

**Access Level**

Other

**Reason for Change**

At the end of the system screen recording, a screenshot API provided by the window module will be called to generate a thumbnail of the screen, which will then trigger a screenshot event. This event can interfere with listeners of third-party applications if these applications have subscribed to screenshot events through the window module.

To mitigate this problem, the window module has introduced a new screenshot API designated for the system screen recording application. This way, third-party applications will no longer capture the screenshot events generated by system screen recording application.

**Impact of the Change**

This change does not require application adaptation.

Before change: When system screen recording ends, third-party applications receive a callback event if they have subscribed to screenshot events through the window module.

After change: When system screen recording ends, third-party applications do not receive a callback event if they have subscribed to screenshot events through the window module.
